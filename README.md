# Usage
- In the app you can save the details of fuel refills.
- You can then export (share) the data as a json file to some place conveinient. (I'd recommend a dedicated folder in google drive/onedrive for this.)
- Istall desktop client for the cloud-service of your choise and enable offline access for the specific folder.
- Open the attached excel spreadsheet on your computer (Uses Power Query so might not work on excel versions older than 2016).
- Point the File path present on one of the cells to the locallly synced cloud folder.
- Refresh the data.
- (You may wish to hide the first entry as most of the calculations wont work for it. )
